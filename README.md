# What-and-Where-are-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses
In this project, I will explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?
we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
To answer the question, What and Where are the Worlds OldestBusinesses?, the following tasks were undertaken
    1. The oldest business in the world
    2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?
    3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?
    4. Exploring the categories
    5. Counting the categories
    6. Oldest business by continent
    7. Joining everything for further analysis
    8. Counting categories by continent
    9. Filtering counts by continent and category
